### How do I approach designing software? 

- After almost being done with this course, I have learned a lot in this class relating to design. For instance, I have learned the importance of lighting in a 3D world, and how you the designer must account for it. By accounting for lighting, I was able to implement a light source for my final project. For future projects, this can be used by determining the type, intensity, and color of lighting needed, which will then be implemented.

### How do I approach developing programs? 

- While working on the final project, I noticed that the assignment was designed in a way to allow the developer to add incremental changes to the project. This methodology resulted in a final product that utilzied all of the concepts from this term. Iterative changes were also present in the development of the program, by implementing the instructor's feedback into the program. As I was nearing the program's completion, I became more familiar with the program's predefined functions, which allowed me to implement complex features such as ortho/perspective view and lighting.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

- Before taking this course, I had no experience with computational graphics. However, this course exposed me to important tools such as OpenGL, which is commonly used in 3D programs. The skills and concepts in this course can be used for courses that utilize technologies such as OpenGL. In addition to this, this class can also be helpful in my career, by offering some knowledge as to how graphics cards are used to create 3D graphics.
